# Querying Semi Structured Data
This program aims to automate the process of error checking and merging/concatenating tables present in tab seperated files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisits
- Java development kit 8 or higher must be installed on the machine that the program is going to be run on

To run the supplied .jar file on a pc you must have a minimum of Java 8 installed, Excel is not required to be running or present on the system for the program to work.

As of the MVP version, all excel files input into the program must only contain the table (headers and data) otherwise the program will mistake any other data as being part of a table.
There should only be one table present per sheet but there is no limit on the number of sheets allowed for the program to work correctly.
